### Radio:

##### Classification:

![[Pasted image 20231219210352.png]]

- **FR type I (core-brightened) and type II (edge-brightend)** (Fig.2)

radio galaxy (RQ) classification

![[Pasted image 20231214204614.png]]

- **steep- and flat- spectrum sources**

$S_\nu\propto\nu^{-\alpha}$ 

(roughly ~ **extended and compact sources**)

**blazar** (FSRQs and BL Lacs (optical spectra difference) ) $\in$   flat -spec 

**blazars** dominate the **bright radio and $\gamma$-ray sky**

a ***strong radio flux density* is one of the most efficient (albeit incomplete) AGN selection criteria

- **Radio-loud and -quiet (RL, RQ) AGN**

(most used of radio AGN)

**threshold**: radio lumin or radio/optical (mainly for Type-1 AGN) (K = 0 or 1)
$$R_K=\log L_{radio}-K\cdot\log L_{\Delta\lambda}=0$$

The two classes --> intrinsically different objects

**RL AGN**: emitting a large fraction of their energy non-thermally and in association with powerful relativistic jets.

**RQ AGN**: dominated by thermal emission, directly or indirectly related to the accretion disk

main difference: the presence or lack of strong relativistic jets (**“jetted” and “non-jetted”**)

- **Low- and high-excitation AGN** (LEG and HEG)

based on their optical spectra 

**quasars** and **Seyferts** $\in$ HEG

**[[LINER]]** and absorption line galaxies $\in$ LEG

**LEG**: redder, higher stellar mass, larger 4000A break (age?)

**LEG**: low accretion rate from hot phase IGM, more **collimated (准直的) jet**, radiatively inefficient, geometrically thick (but optically thin) disk accretion flow 

**HEG**: high accretion rate form cold IGM, unlikely to collimated jet,  radiatively efficient, geometrically thin (but optically thick) disk accretion flow

(*What the accretion scale: galaxy or SMBH?* )

- **Unification**:

FR I and 20% FR II ---> LEG

most FR II  ---> HEG

powerful radio quasars and RG ---> HEG

less powerful RG ---> LEG

'Classical' non-jetted AGN (Seyferts and quasar)  ----> HEG

larger obscuration of FR II/HEG than FR I/LEG (whether there is dust)

- **Identify AGN detected in radio-band:**
	- rest-frame optical colours of the host galaxies, which have been shown to correlate with the galaxies spectral emission line properties
	- X-ray luminosity
	- mid-IR (MIR) colors
	- multi SED fitting
	- etc

##### Selection effect:

star-forming contribution to the total radio luminosity output

radio emission from synchrotron radiation generated by supernova remnants

HEG more likely to associated with SF in their host galaxies than LEG.

##### Cosmic evolution of radio-selected AGN

**'downsizing' effect:** low radio luminosity sources evolve less strongly than high-luminosity ones

peak AGN activity from massive to less massive as cosmic time evolve.

more powerful AGN have it peak density at a higher redshift


### Infrared

##### Physical mechanism

dusty torus paradigm (MIR)

![[Pasted image 20231216160954.png]]

true Type-2 AGN：free of BLR.
**dust torus is clumpy or smooth?**:
	- Some: Silicate 9.7 $\mu$m ----> clumpy  (Why?)
	- Not yet able to discriminate two model

fraction of Type 1 and Type 2

contamination:
	- star forming at a cooler temperature (40K) and at FIR
	- stellar 1.6 $\mu$m peak at cross-over of AGN disk and dust emission
	-  MIR is a good band


##### AGN in MIR (photometry)

- **MIR broad-band identification:**

Before JWST era:
	- IRAS, Spitzer, WISE
	- AGN are expected to be significantly redder in the shorter wavelength MIR bands
	- Different color selection criteria

**Comparison between other band:**

MIR AGN identification is considerably less sensitive to obscuration of the central engine by dust compared to optical identification. 
(**Better than optical**)

**X-ray:**
	- sensitive to obscured sources (high penetrate)(?)
	- less affected by HI absorption
	- more integration time

**Contaminants**:
	- SFG with powerful PAH emission make it redder.
	- High redshift (>1) massive galaxies with 1.6$\mu$m peak redshifted to MIR
	- Galactic sources (brown dwarf and young stellar object)

**What's missing by MIR?:**
	- Dust free AGN
	- low $L/L_{Edd}$ (low $L_{\nu,AGN}/L_{\nu,host}$), AGN in disk

##### MIR spectroscopy

detect obscured AGN components even when the MIR is dominated by the host galaxy:
	- high ionization emission lines
	- EW of PAH features
	- strength of Silicate 9.7$\mu$m


### Optical

focus on quasars and Seyfert 1 (type 1 AGN)

##### Physical Mechanism

**accretion** gives rise to high X-ray-to-optical luminosities, a characteristic rest-frame UV/optical power-law continuum (**big blue bump**), and a break of 1000A

**accretion disk:** geometrically thin, optically thick

BLR, NLR

##### Photometric and spectroscopic identification:

color-color
![[Pasted image 20231218164458.png]]

**Broad band photometry** is sensitive to the presence of broad emission lines in the various filters as a function of redshift.

**Spectroscopy**:  the presence of narrow emission lines in the spectra of galaxies and their ratios are indicative of the presence of an AGN.

BPT diagram (Fig.3)

![[Pasted image 20231219165216.png]]

**Problem**:  in the optical, stars far outnumber AGN at typical survey depths ----> optical selection


##### Selection effects:

**Unobscured AGN with colour in the stellar locus**:
	- Incomplete quasars with stellar contamination. (与redshift有关？)

**Lower-luminosity AGN**:
	- without spectroscopy, it is difficult to distinguish a normal galaxy from an active galaxy
	- variability not help much

**Type 2 AGN**:
	irony: a large fraction of known type 2 AGN are still selected in the optical
	reason: host galaxy strong emission mislead to AGN-like colors (as Type 1)




##### Information content:

Information from **continuum, emission and absorption lines**

e.g. BAL (broad absorption lines) quasars ----> outflow winds in AGN

![[Pasted image 20231218172622.png]]

We can learn about AGN winds using emission + absorption line ----> AGN outflows

**Diversity of quasars**

##### $L/L_{Edd}$  and  $M_{BH}$

utilise BH mass scaling relations to estimate the masses of the BHs powering quasars


### X-ray

##### Physical Mechanism

**Advantage**: provide a near complete selection of AGN with low contamination from non-AGN systems

**(near) universality**, high penetrating power


**Primary process**: **inverse Compton scattering** of the accretion-disk photons to X-ray energies via the accretion-disk “**corona**” (connected to accretion-disk emission)

Other:
	- Thermal emission from inner accretion disk
	- Modification due to interaction with nuclear region ---> **broad range of X-ray spectra shape**


##### Identification


selection effect:  lower energy X-rays are more easily absorbed than higher energy X-rays (Fig.9)

use high energy

**CT AGN is difficult to detect** (the absorbing column density exceeds the inverse
of the Thomson scattering cross section) (very heavily obscured) (radio and IR)

Contamination:
	- X-ray binary (at <10 keV, LMXB ~ stellar mass, HMXB ~ SFR) with LLAGN 
	- Hot gas (can be very luminous, but at <2-5 keV)
	- Reliable for high energy X-ray band



##### Selection of AGN in X-ray band

absorbed and unabsorbed AGN of low, moderate, and high luminosity

Most:
	**- Optical type 1  ----> X-ray unabsorbed
	- Optical type 2 ----> X-ray absorbed**
	- Outliers: variability (not enough)



$L/L_{Edd}$  -  $M_{BH}$ plane

**Selection effect**: the probability of detecting a low $L/L_{Edd}$ AGN with a massive BH is significantly higher than a high $L/L_{Edd}$  AGN with a low-mass BH due to the flux limit.

AGN downsizing: Fig.12



### $\gamma$ - ray

focus on blazars (BL Lac and FSRQ) (very rare)

HE band: 100 MeV - 100 GeV

VHE band: 50 GeV - 10 TeV

##### SED and physical mechanism

blazars covers entire EM spectrum, dominated by **non-thermal, blue-shifted, and Doppler
boosted radiation** arising in a relativistic jet pointed in the direction of the observer.

two components in blazar SED (**double humped shape**):
	- Synchrotron radiation (lower than X-ray band) (**HSP and LSP**)
	- $\gamma$-ray component (debated models):
		- Leptonic models: **inverse Compton scatter**
		- Hadronic scenarios: **HE protons synchrotron emission**, **photo-meson interactions** (**neutrino** emitter) 

![[Pasted image 20231219210352.png]]
##### $\gamma$-ray detectors

HE band: electron pair-conversion telescope (in space)

VHE band: Cherenkov telescope, charged particles in the shower 

##### HE band:

best sensitivity: Fermi-LAT

two detect approach:
	- 'blind' with conservative statistical thresholds (3FGL)
	- searching for $\gamma$-ray excess at the positions of blazars (or candidates) (1BIBG)

##### VHE band

**Challenge**: VHE $\gamma$ -rays are subject to pair production interactions with the extragalactic background light

majority is **HSP**

##### Blazar population properties

blazar $\gamma$-ray LF: broken power law



Integrated emission from blazars and RGs can **explain both the intensity and the spectral shape** of the extragalactic background in the 100 MeV–820 GeV energy band. (No much room for DM annihilation)


Selection effect: 
	steep γ -ray spectra FSRQs/LSPs  are detected less efficiently than hard γ -ray spectra HSP BL Lacs.



### Variability:

Variability of the emitted multi-wavelength (from radio to γ -ray) radiation has been recognized as one of the main characteristics of AGN as a class.

variability power over timescales: **PSD**

Variability depends on observing band:
	X-ray faster than optical

minimum timescale of variability ----> the linear size of the source component emitting in that waveband:
		**X-ray ----> corona and inner disk
		UV/Optical ----> outer disk**

**longer time scale variability**: indirect study with extended emission line regions
##### X-ray variability

**red noise:** occurrence of larger amplitude variations on longer timescales.

**universal shape** for X-ray PSD of AGN: a steep high-f slope, a low-f flat slope, break frequency $\nu_b$

$\nu_b$ ---->  a physical timescale of the flow at some characteristic radius, scales (inversely) with $M_{BH}$ (even for stellar mass BH, accreting NS, WD)

##### UV/Optical variability

region: accretion disk

Property:
	- days - months timescale
	- steeper PSD high-f slope
	- PSD break at longer timescale
	- no clear dependance on BH mass

**red lags** on day/sub-day timescale: with longer wavelengths lagging behind shorter wavelengths
<------ central X-ray heating 

On months - years scale optical > X-ray

##### Physical Mechanism

**X-ray 'rms-flux' relation**:  the source is more variable when it is brighter.  ----> multiplicative process

**“propagating-fluctuation” model:**  local perturbations of disk parameters triggering variations of the accretion rate:
	- Intrinsic UV/optical disk variability
	- Hard X-ray lag

**Variations of photoelectric absorption**: gas clouds in BLR or torus (**not the bulk**)

##### AGN variability in extragalactic surveys

- **Selecting AGN by variability:**

whether the **variability observed between observations** exceeds **the variations due to statistical fluctuations**.

**selection effect**: a fraction of emission from the nucleus is directly observable 

The longer the **maximum sampled timescales**, the **higher the detection fraction** and the **larger the range of BH mass and Eddington ratio** probed

- **Variability dependence on luminosity and redshift**

**normalized excess variance**: an estimate of the amplitude of intrinsic source variability over the sampled timescales.

variability is anti-correlated with luminosity in several wavebands (**Unknown**)


### Summary

 (1) variations in the underlying physical properties of AGN; 
 (2) observational capabilities; 
 (3) selection effects.

Physical effect:
	- Jetted or non jetted
	- High or low accretion rate
	- Dust torus

![[Pasted image 20231220172625.png]]


**Selection effect:** 
	- relative emission of the AGN compared to its host galaxy.
	- Table 3

##### Fitting together the components of an AGN:

- Black hole:
	-  Mass
	-  Spin: large spin ---> closer disk ---> bluer SED (influence jet and radiation line-driven winds)
- Accretion flow:
	- ultimate energy source
	- flow changes with Eddington ratios
- Torus
	- emission from AGN in IR
	- obscuration of the accretion disk and corona emission
- Jet:
	- the physical nature of AGN jets and the prevalence of relativistic outflows, particularly low-luminosity jets on small scales, remain uncertain
- Host galaxy and DM halo:
	-  host galaxy dilution
	- gas influence on the fueling


##### Unified Scheme

two parameters except orientation: accretion rate, jet strength
